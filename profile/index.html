                <p>Hi! My name is Dimas Aria Pujangga. You can call me Dimas! I was born and raised in Jakarta, January 24th 2003. Now, 
                    I'm 20 years old. I'm undergraduate student at Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS), specializing in Informatics Engineering.
                    
                    <br>Apart from my academic life, I'm a sports enthusiast through and through. You'll often find me on the tennis and football courts, 
                    where I not only enjoy the games but also actively participate to improve my skills and foster teamwork. There's something incredibly 
                    fulfilling about the physical and mental challenges that these sports offer. 
                    
                    <br>In my downtime, I'm an avid video gamer, and one of my all-time favorites is Football Manager. Managing and strategizing with virtual 
                    football teams provides a different kind of thrill and strategic thinking that I love to immerse myself in. 
                    
                    <br>Balancing my academic pursuits, sports interests, and gaming passion has taught me valuable time-management skills and enriched my college 
                    experience. As I continue my journey at ITS, I'm excited to see where my passion for technology and diverse interests will take me.
